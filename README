I have implemented this homework on my own server and it worked well.
Due to time constraints I could not deploy on Jetty and test again.
Please test on Jetty if you wish to. The web.xml files and paths are specified below.
Just to make sure, I have tried the war files 
and on running “jar tf worker.war” all my classes and jars are in the correct packages.

*** I have included the target folder too, because I have not tested it on Jetty, 
*** I wanted to make sure my code works on my own server with my web.xml files.
*** Apologies for the inconvenience, please replace it with your target. If it doesn't work, try my target.

*** In workerweb.xml, the port to which the worker listens to is specified in following convention:
       <servlet>
       .....
         <init-param>
           <param-name>listeningPort</param-name>
           <param-value>3000</param-value>
         </init-param>
       .....
       </servlet>


I have implemented the Context interface in edu.upenn.cis455.mapreduce.job.MyContext.java
My WordCount.java writes using that object. 
I have abstracted the deletion, creation and writing of files in MyContext.
The worker will determine and direct the context regarding the job and directory the writing has to happen.

I have added three web.xml files in the target/worker/WEB-INF:
worker1web.xml
worker2web.xml
worker3web.xml

The master web.xml is in target/master/WEB-INF:
masterweb.xml

Now to run the master, 
Run configuration is the following arguments in command line:

8008
./testfiles
./target/master/WEB-INF/masterweb.xml

To run the workers these are the command line arguments:
1. Worker1:
3000
./testfiles
./target/worker/WEB-INF/worker1web.xml

2. Worker2:
4000
./testfiles
./target/worker/WEB-INF/worker2web.xml

3. Worker3:
5000
./testfiles
./target/worker/WEB-INF/worker3web.xml

So we are opening multiple servers listening on different ports.
As you can see, I have opened the master on 8008, worker1 on 3000, worker2 on 4000 and worker3 on 5000.
Other ports would also work, but we need to change the web.xmls according to the port numbers.

Also, I have created three folders for storage directories, as specified by the workerXweb.xmls
Worker1: storage1
Worker2: storage2
Worker3: storage3

My testing was done on three files, placed in the input folders of each storage directory:
storage1/input/in3.txt: 
1	it is very hard in the beginning
2	to understand that the whole idea
3	is not to beat the runners
4	eventually you learn
5	that the competition is against the little voice inside you
6	that wants you to quit

storage2/input/in2.txt:
1	on a day no different than the one now dawning
2	Leonardo drew the first strokes of the Mona Lisa
3	Shakespeare wrote the first words of Hamlet
4	Beethoven began work on his Ninth symphony and
5	Einstein discovered the theory of relativity
6	what are you going to do today

storage3/input/in1.txt: (An article from google news)
1	LUHANSK, Ukraine, April 8 (Reuters) - Past the barricades of metal railings, 
2	sandbags and barbed wire, Russian separatists peer out of the state security building 
3	in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, rifles in hand.
4	The headquarters of the former KGB in this small Ukrainian city less than 30 km (20 miles) from the
5	Russian border is potentially the most dangerous flashpoint among buildings in eastern Ukraine seized on 
6	Sunday night by pro-Moscow agitators.
7	Activists inside have seized an armoury of automatic rifles. 
8	The Ukrainian security service says they have also wired the building with 
9	explosives and are holding around 60 people there against their will, 
10	although the activists deny this.
11	They say they are here for as long as it takes to 
12	force a referendum on the region's status within Ukraine.
13	“I’ll stay here until the end, until victory. Once you've taken up arms, 
14	there's no turning back," said Andrei, one of the men inside, who refused to give his family name.
15	Holding a police shield, he confirmed that protesters had found 
16	the arsenal of weapons stored in the security building - around 200-300 Kalashnikovs, 
17	he said, and some stun grenades.

I have added toreduce.txt file to each storage/spoolin after the mapping is done.
On sorting this file, we get another file called reduce.txt file.

Now my final results will be placed in:
storageX/output/result.txt

On concatenating all the results, and checking with online word counter tools, they were matching correctly.

To Test from browser:
Now on opening the browser and going to the following url:

http://localhost:8008/status

You will get the statuses of the active workers and the web form.
I have some default values filled in that form for initial testing.
On submitting, the workers will be assigned jobs to map, and we will be redirected to another page. 
On clicking 'Go To Status page' we will return to the status page and view the statuses of each worker.

Now if we stop one of the threads and wait for 30 seconds, and go to the same /status url, 
we notice that the active workers will only be displayed.
If the page is not displayed, please try reloading and the fresh page will display the active workers.
